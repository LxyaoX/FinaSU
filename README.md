FinaSU is a kernel-based root solution for Android, built on [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU). It combines kernel-level `su` and root access management with a module system, a built-in Zygisk engine, SUSFS support, and a configurable modern manager.

---

## Overview

FinaSU provides:

- Kernel-based `su` with whitelist-based root access management
- A Magisk-like module system based on overlayfs and metamodules
- App Profile, to confine root power to a per-app policy
- The built-in FolkZygisk engine, with manager controls
- The built-in Sui extension, which serves the Shizuku API to supported apps
- SUSFS support, gated by kernel capability
- Kernel-level hiding: mount hiding, SELinux hiding, AVC log spoofing, and unmount policy
- `.fpt` themes with FolkPatch-compatible exchange, plus an online theme store
- Multi-page wallpapers, custom fonts, and a launcher icon switcher
- Module repository browsing and one-tap installation
- An in-app language picker with community translations

## Requirements

- An arm64-v8a Android device on a GKI kernel **6.1 or newer** - the Android 14 generation and later. Older kernels (5.10, 5.15, the 4.x trees) are not supported: the module refuses to build for them, and the manager says so instead of offering an install.
- Installation via LKM (a loadable `kernelsu.ko`), a patched boot image, or an AnyKernel3 package

## Manager

- Multiple home layouts, including GridUI and dashboard-style pages
- Configurable theming: colors, wallpapers, and fonts
- A category-based settings hub covering general, appearance, behavior, function, security, and backup options
- Optional update checks and boot-time module blocking

## Modules and Extensions

### KernelSU modules

Standard KernelSU modules are managed from the manager. Modules are injected through NoMount, the built-in VFS backend, so no metamodule is needed; a single active metamodule is still recognised and listed.

### FolkZygisk

FolkZygisk is a built-in Zygisk engine. The manager exposes its installation and activation controls, and `ksud` steps the built-in engine aside whenever an external Zygisk provider is active, so provider modules install normally.

### Sui

Sui is the built-in Shizuku API backend, for the apps that talk to Shizuku: they reach this extension instead of a separate Shizuku installation. The payload is built by this repository and embedded in ksud, so installation, enable and disable, and repair belong to FinaSU rather than to Sui's own installer, and `ksud` supervises the injected root and shell servers.

The manager hosts the whole interface: the per-app Shizuku permission list, the default permission, the apps hidden from Sui, diagnostics, and the prompt for a real permission request, which is answered over the management channel. Sui's own management UI is not shipped.

### SUSFS

SUSFS management is capability-gated. The controls appear only on kernels that support it, and every configuration change is applied with a receipt.

### Folk-Mount

Folk-Mount is the name the manager gives its module-mount backend. Only two settings exist: NoMount (the VFS driver, the default) and off.

### NoMount

NoMount is the built-in VFS redirection backend: instead of mounting anything it takes over path resolution and directory iteration in a kernel module, so `/proc/mounts` stays clean. The module ships inside ksud (embedded per KMI, built by this repository); the backend needs neither a metamodule nor the `nm` binary.

The manager exposes the driver state, the number of active rules, visibility exclusions and a "mounting off" mode; the backend can be set to NoMount (the default) or off. There is no second engine behind it: when the driver cannot be loaded, nothing is injected for that boot and the settings page says so instead of mounting another way. ksud also records each risky step before it runs: if a NoMount injection never reached boot completion, the next boot skips injection entirely, and the reason lands in `/data/adb/ksu/log/mount.log` — the same bounded, rotated log that records how many rules each boot injected and which directories they landed in, which is what a bug report needs to tell whether an injection touched a boot-critical path. To find out what a stuck boot was waiting for, arm `ksud mount capture on` first (150s after a boot that never finishes, or `ksud mount capture on 60`; `off` disarms): the capture lands in `/data/adb/ksu/log/mount_capture.log` with the blocked-task stacks from `sysrq w`, the end of the kernel log, the D-state tasks and pstore. Visibility is an exception list kept by ksud: every app sees the injected files until it is added, and the NoMount page copies each app profile's "unmount modules" verdict into that list on demand, so later profile changes need another copy.

Directory symlinks are traversed as directories and merged file by file, with cycle detection and per-module path deduplication. A `.replace` marker or opaque directory defaults to file merging; only the explicitly allowlisted `/product/fonts` target may become a directory redirect, and only when its stock target is absent or empty. Partition roots and directories named `lib64`, `lib`, `bin` or `etc` are never directory-replaced. Downgrades are logged, `mount.log` includes `dir_replace=N`, and `ksud nomount inject --dry-run --verbose` labels file redirects and directory replacements separately.

### TEESimulator

TEESimulator answers key-attestation requests for the apps you select from AOSP's reference KeyMint implementation running in-process, so the chain it returns is the one a real device would produce instead of a hand-rolled certificate. FinaSU ships the payload inside the manager: the switch stages it under `/data/adb/teesim/runtime`, hands its `sepolicy.rule` to `ksud sepolicy apply` and starts the daemon from a `post-fs-data.d` hook, so no module appears in the list and the first enable needs no reboot. Attestation is only as good as the keybox you import - with none, the interceptor stays inert and every key keeps going to the real hardware. The runtime's native logd reader is not deployed, so nothing is written to `/data/adb/teesim/log`; the manager page is the only configuration surface.

## Security

The manager authenticates itself by APK signature: only the trusted manager and apps the user has explicitly claimed can manage the kernel. Root access is whitelist-based, so only granted apps can reach `su`. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.

## Translation

English and Chinese are the reference languages. Only submit corrections for the target language, and include the entire translated file when adding a new language.

## Download and Installation

1. Download the latest package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LyraVoid/FinaSU/releases/latest).
2. Install the manager on the device.
3. Follow the in-app flow to install the kernel module, patch a boot image, or flash an AnyKernel3 package.

## Building from Source

The repository ships a local mirror of the CI pipeline:

```bash
./build.sh ksud     # build the Rust userspace daemon
./build.sh lkm      # build the kernel module
./build.sh apk      # build the manager APK (requires the ksud build)
./build.sh all      # full local run
```

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the per-component build and check commands.
