/**
 * The bundled PlayIntegrityFix payload: where it lives, what it is doing, and the one file this page
 * edits.
 *
 * The payload belongs to ksud. It ships inside `libksud.so`, ksud writes it to [ROOT] on every boot
 * and links that directory into `/data/adb/modules` there - because the library it carries opens
 * `/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix/{module.prop,pif.prop,classes.dex}` by absolute name and has
 * no setting to move them. The link is a symbolic link, which is what keeps the thing out of the
 * module list and out of NoMount's planner.
 *
 * So nothing here installs or removes a module: this object reports what ksud left on disk, flips
 * the disable marker that zygiskd reads, and edits `pif.prop` - the identity and the six switches.
 * The one write that belongs to ksud is [reinstall], which is how a payload whose files were damaged
 * is put back.
